    <h1>System Coherence</h1>
      <h3>Modern digital systems rarely fail because of a single bad decision. They fail because of fragmentation.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fragmented tools.</li>
          <li>Fragmented logic.</li>
          <li>Fragmented ownership.</li>
          <li>Fragmented responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>System Coherence is the practice of designing technology so that all parts of a system reinforce each other instead of competing with each other.
      At Auralicode, system coherence means that design, architecture, performance, security, scalability, and user experience are not treated as separate concerns. They are treated as one continuous system, evolving together.</p>

      <h2>What System Coherence Means in Practice</h2>
      <h3>A Coherent System:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Has a clear mental model for users and developers</li>
          <li>Avoids unnecessary abstraction and duplication</li>
          <li>Aligns UI, business logic, and data structures</li>
          <li>Scales without accumulating technical debt</li>
          <li>Remains understandable months or years later</li>
          <li>I don’t build “features.”</li>
          <li>I build systems that make sense.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>That means every component exists for a reason, every dependency is intentional, and every layer of the stack supports the layers above and below it.</p>

      <h2>Why Coherence Matters</h2>
      <h3>Incoherent Systems:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Become expensive to maintain</li>
          <li>Require constant patching</li>
          <li>Create hidden failure points</li>
          <li>Lock teams into reactive mode</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Coherent Systems:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce long-term costs</li>
          <li>Improve reliability and performance</li>
          <li>Enable faster iteration</li>
          <li>Empower teams instead of burdening them</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Coherence Over Complexity</h2>
      <h3>Complexity is easy to create. Coherence requires discipline.</h3>
      <h4>I Intentionally Favor:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear architecture over clever tricks</li>
          <li>Readability over novelty</li>
          <li>Stability over hype<</li>
          <li>Long-term clarity over short-term speed</li>
          <li>Technology should feel calm, not chaotic.</li>
        </ul>
