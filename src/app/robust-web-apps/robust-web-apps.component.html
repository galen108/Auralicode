      <h1>Systems designed to evolve — not just launch</h1>
        <h3>This tier extends the Web Applications model to support growth, change, and continued longevity.</h3>
        <h4>It is appropriate when a system:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Will expand significantly</li>
          <li>Must remain stable under change</li>
          <li>Requires operational visibility</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="robust-apps-pitch">
      <h2>What this tier delivers—</h2>
      <h4>Deeper activation of capabilities:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>More complex domain and business logic</li>
          <li>Evolving data models</li>
          <li>Environment parity (dev / staging / production)</li>
          <li>Deployment workflows and rollback strategies</li>
          <li>Monitoring, logging, and performance insight</li>
          <li>Ongoing architectural refinement</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>This tier emphasizes operational calm — systems that don’t rely on undue heroics.</h4>
        <h2>What clients experience:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Confidence adding features over time</li>
          <li>Fewer surprises as the system grows</li>
          <li>Clear understanding of system behavior</li>
          <li>Reduced long-term technical debt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Best for:</h2>
        <h4>Growing SaaS platforms</h4>
        <h4>Data-driven applications</h4>
        <h4>Products with active roadmaps</h4>
        <h4>Teams planning long-term ownership</h4>

    <section class="robust-apps-pricing">
      <h2>Why These Prices?</h2>
        <p>My pricing reflects two decades of full-stack engineering, architecture, cloud orchestration, and design experience. Instead of paying for an agency full of junior developers, you get one senior engineer responsible for every line of code, every system, and every decision — resulting in faster delivery, tighter quality control, and dramatically better long-term stability.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="robust-apps-scope">
      <h2>Rate: $120 / hour (with increased architectural scope) — Typical investment range: $18,000 – $45,000+</h2>
        <h3>Why the rate stays the same — but the scope expands: The hourly rate reflects senior architectural work already established in the Web Applications tier.</h3>
        <h4>What increases here is—</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Time horizon</li>
          <li>System depth</li>
          <li>Integration complexity</li>
          <li>Operational responsibility</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>This tier includes:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Deployment pipelines</li>
          <li>Environment parity</li>
          <li>Monitoring and logging</li>
          <li>Performance tuning</li>
          <li>Ongoing refactoring and stewardship</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>This is where systems are designed not just to launch — but to steadilly endure.</h4>
    </section>
    <section class="cta">
      <h2>Every tier reflects the same philosophy.</h2>
      <h4>What changes is how much of the system is activated.</h4>
      <p>If you’re building something that matters — and you want it to hold together as it grows — <a class="btn btn-primary" routerLink="/contact">we should talk.</a></p>
