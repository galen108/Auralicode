      <h1>Auralicode — Built on Listening, Rooted in Service, Driven by Purpose</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="about-intro">
      <h2>
        Auralicode wasn’t created just to build websites.
      </h2>
        <p>It was created to serve people. My name is Galen Tenney — Founder, Lead Architect, designer, developer, musician, creative, lifelong Apple enthusiast, and someone who genuinely believes technology should lift people up, not overwhelm them. I live in the Mid-Atlantic region with my wife, Pamela, who is one of my greatest inspirations and supports in this journey.</p>
      <h4>The word Auralicode begins with “Aural” for a reason:</h4>
      <strong>Before I ever write a line of code, I listen.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>To your story.</li>
          <li>To your challenges.</li>
          <li>To your hopes for what technology could do for you.</li>
          <li>Because every meaningful solution begins with understanding.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>
        Why I Do This Work
      </h2>
        <p>I’ve spent decades working across government, nonprofit, corporate, and creative spaces — and I’ve seen amazing technology, but I’ve also seen systems that feel cold, impersonal, extractive, and disconnected from the people they claim to serve. I believe something better is possible.</p>
      <h4>Auralicode exists because:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I value principles over personality</li>
          <li>I believe in service as a calling</li>
          <li>I believe in craftsmanship, care, and integrity</li>
          <li>I believe technology should be empathetic, ethical, accessible, and human-centered</li>
          <li>I believe helping others isn’t transactional — it’s meaningful</li>
          <li>As a follower of Christ, I try to live by:</li>
          <li>“Love God. Love your neighbor.”</li>
          <li>And I bring that spirit of compassion, humility, and service into the work I do every day.</li>
          <li>I am also proudly progressive — believing in fairness, dignity, justice, inclusion, and the idea that technology should lessen burdens, not deepen divides.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>
        A Designer’s Eye, a Developer’s Mind, and a Creative Heart
      </h2>
        <p>From an early age I was immersed in creativity, design, and technology.
        (Thanks, Dad — for introducing me to Apple early on, and for showing me what honest entrepreneurship looks like.)</p>
      <h4>Today, that passion is woven into everything I build.</h4>
      <strong>I love:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Beautifully engineered Apple experiences</li>
          <li>Thoughtful digital craftsmanship</li>
          <li>Music — playing it, listening to it, living in it</li>
          <li>Writing, reading, expressing ideas</li>
          <li>Time in nature — to remember we belong to something greater than screens</li>
          <li>And I pour all of that into Auralicode.</li>
          <li>What Auralicode Does Differently</li>
          <li>Plenty of companies build websites.</li>
          <li>Auralicode builds relationships, trust, clarity, and solutions that genuinely help people.</li>
        </ul>
      <strong>I specialize in:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Bespoke custom web applications</li>
          <li>modern, elegant websites</li>
          <li>UI/UX experiences that feel right</li>
          <li>Modernization and problem-solving</li>
          <li>Thoughtful technical guidance</li>
        </ul>
      <strong>But more importantly, I specialize in</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Listening deeply
          <li>Understanding the real problem
          <li>Being honest
          <li>Delivering with care
          <li>Technology shouldn’t make you feel small or confused.
          <li>It shouldn’t talk down to you.
          <li>It shouldn’t be built just for profit at the expense of people.
          <li>It should empower you. Support you. Serve your mission.
          <li><strong>That’s what brings me joy.</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="about-meaning">
      <h2>
        Why the Name Matters — Auralicode = Aural (listening + human experience) + Code (craft, structure, precision)
      </h2>
        <p>It represents: Empathy + Engineering; Humanity + Technology; Heart + Skill: That balance is everything.</p>
      <h4>If We Work Together:</h4>
        <p><strong>You won’t be treated like “a client.” You’ll be treated like a person, with a dream worth building well.</strong></p>
        <p>I will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listen first</li>
          <li>Communicate honestly</li>
          <li>Build intentionally</li>
          <li>Respect your vision</li>
          <li>Care deeply about the outcome</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because this isn’t just business for me. It’s purpose. It’s calling. It’s joy.</p>
