    <section class="about-intro">
      <p>
        I’m Galen Tenney — designer, developer, and founder of Auralicode. My background spans music, graphic design, and over 20 years of web development. This blend of creativity and technical precision allows me to create applications that are both beautiful and built to last.

    <section class="about-value">
      <p>
        As a one-person studio, you work directly with the person writing your code, <a class="btn btn-primary" routerLink="/portfolio">designing your UI</a>, and making key architectural decisions. My design experience ensures your app feels cohesive and engaging; my technical depth makes it secure, scalable, and <a class="btn btn-primary" routerLink="/services">easy to maintain</a>.

    </section>

    <section class="about-philosophy">
      <p>
        I believe in building original, human-led solutions using modern frameworks, robust testing, and automation — never cookie-cutter templates or unchecked AI output.

    <section class="about-personal">
      <p>
        I’m based in the Mid-Atlantic with my wife, Pamela. Outside of development, I’m a lifelong musician, reader, and design enthusiast who values clear communication and continuous learning.
