      <p>
        I’m Galen Tenney: designer, developer, and founder of Auralicode. My career has taken me through music, graphic design, and over two decades of web development. That mix of creativity and technical discipline is what lets me build applications that are both beautiful and built to last.

    <section class="about-value">
      <p>
        Because I’m a one-person studio, you get direct access to the person writing your code, designing your UI, and making architectural decisions. My background in graphic design means your app won’t just work — it will feel cohesive and engaging. My technical depth means it will be secure, scalable, and maintainable.

    <section class="about-philosophy">
      <p>
        I believe in crafting digital products with care, using the right mix of modern frameworks, testing, and automation — but never outsourcing critical thinking to AI. Your business deserves solutions that are as original as your brand, not cookie-cutter builds.

    <section class="about-personal">
      <p>
        I live in the Mid-Atlantic Region with my wife, Pamela. I’m a lifelong musician, reader, and designer at heart. I value clear communication, continuous learning, and working with clients who care as much about quality as I do.
