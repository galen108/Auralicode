      <h2>PRICING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <h3>Pricing reflects responsibility, not just effort</h3>
      <h4>Auralicode pricing is based on:</h4>
      • Architectural responsibility
      • System complexity
      • Integration surface area
      • Risk management
      • Long-term stewardship
      • Lower tiers prioritize foundational coherence.
      • Higher tiers activate deeper architectural accountability.
      • The hourly rate reflects the level of responsibility assumed — not a change in care, quality, or intent.

      <h3>Services & Engagements</h3>
      <h4>Coherent systems, delivered at the right scale</h4>
      • Auralicode offers services across a range of scopes — from foundational web presences to complex, multi-system applications.
      • Every engagement applies the same core principles:
      • System Coherence
      • Deliberate Technology
      • Explicit architectural decisions
      • Human-reviewed craftsmanship
      • What changes between tiers is scope, depth, and responsibility — not quality or intent.

      <h3>How pricing works</h3>
      <h4>Pricing reflects:</h4>
      • System complexity
      • Architectural responsibility
      • Integration surface area
      • Long-term stewardship expectations
      • Lower tiers focus on foundational coherence.
      • Higher tiers activate deeper system design, integration, and evolution.
      • No tier is a shortcut.
      • Each tier is a boundary.
