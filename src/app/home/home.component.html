      <p>
        I’m Galen Tenney, founder and sole developer at Auralicode. For every project, I start by listening — really listening — to your needs, goals, and vision. From there, I architect, design, and build component-based single-page applications that are fast, scalable, and easy to maintain. AI assists with the repetitive parts, but the final product is always shaped and refined by human judgment and craftsmanship.
