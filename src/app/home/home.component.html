        I’m Galen Tenney, Founder, Lead Architect, and Developer. Every project begins with a real conversation about your goals, vision, and constraints. From there, I design component-based single-page applications that are entirely scalable, maintainable, and deliberately aligned with your brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI assists with repetitive tasks, but every web application system is shaped by human judgment and accountability.

        <li>Crafted for humans, with interfaces that feel intuitive, responsive, and intentional</li>
      </ul>
