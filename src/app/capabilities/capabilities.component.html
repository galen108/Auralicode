      <h1>Capabilities</h1>
      <h3>What Auralicode builds — and why it holds together</h3>
      <p>Auralicode delivers bespoke software systems designed to remain coherent as they grow, change, and scale. Every engagement is shaped by the same principles: intentional architecture, modern standards, and human-reviewed craftsmanship.
      Capabilities are not sold as packages of tools. They are delivered as systems that work.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="capabilities-web-applications">
      <h2>Web Applications & Platforms</h2>
      <p>Auralicode designs and builds modern web applications with a focus on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Single-page applications (SPAs)</li>
          <li>Multi-step workflows and dashboards</li>
          <li>Public-facing platforms and internal tools</li>
          <li>Progressive enhancement and accessibility</li>
          <li>Responsive design across devices</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Applications are structured to be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understandable by future developers
          <li>Adaptable as requirements evolve
          <li>Consistent across browsers and platforms
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="capabilities-frontend-architecture">
      <h2>Frontend Architecture & Experience</h2>
      <p>Frontend work is approached as system design, not surface polish. Capabilities include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Component-driven architectures</li>
          <li>Design system implementation</li>
          <li>State management with clear boundaries</li>
          <li>Accessibility-first UI decisions</li>
          <li>Performance-aware rendering strategies</li>
          <li>The goal is not visual excess, but predictable behavior and user trust</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="capabilities-backend-logic">
      <h2>Backend & Application Logic</h2>
      <p>Backend systems are designed to support change without collapse. Auralicode builds:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>API-driven application backends</li>
          <li>Authentication and authorization layers</li>
          <li>Business logic with explicit contracts</li>
          <li>Data models designed for evolution</li>
          <li>Secure, auditable service boundaries</li>
          <li>Backends are selected and structured based on the needs of the system — not habit or trend.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="capabilities-authentication-security">
      <h2>Identity, Authentication & Security</h2>
        <p>Identity is treated as infrastructure. Capabilities include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unified authentication models</li>
          <li>Secure session management</li>
          <li>Role-based access control</li>
          <li>OAuth / token-based architectures</li>
          <li>Thoughtful handling of web ↔ mobile boundaries</li>
          <li>Authentication flows are designed before features, ensuring users don’t experience friction, confusion, or dead ends.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="capabilities-cloud-deployment">
      <h2>Cloud & Deployment Architecture</h2>
        <p>Infrastructure is designed to be stable, observable, and recoverable — not over-engineered. Auralicode supports:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Containerized deployments</li>
          <li>Cloud-native hosting strategies</li>
          <li>Environment parity (dev / staging / production)</li>
          <li>Monitoring, logging, and error visibility</li>
          <li>Clean deployment and rollback workflows</li>
          <li>The emphasis is on operational calm, not maximal complexity.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="capabilities-system-boundaries">
      <h2>Integration & System Boundaries</h2>
        <p>Most system failures occur at the seams. Auralicode places special emphasis on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explicit integration contracts</li>
          <li>Third-party API coordination</li>
          <li>Web ↔ service ↔ data boundaries</li>
          <li>Predictable failure modes</li>
          <li>Tested handoff points</li>
          <li>Integrations are designed deliberately so users never feel the system “break character.”</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="capabilities-ongoing-stewardship">
      <h2>Ongoing Evolution & Stewardship</h2>
        <p>Software is not static. Auralicode supports:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Incremental feature growth</li>
          <li>Architectural refactoring</li>
          <li>Performance tuning</li>
          <li>Dependency updates</li>
          <li>Long-term technical stewardship</li>
          <li>The goal is not just launch — it’s sustained coherence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What you won’t find:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inflated technology inventories</li>
          <li>One-size-fits-all packages</li>
          <li>Overpromised timelines</li>
          <li>Trend-driven tooling decisions</li>
          <li>Those belong to enterprise bloat, not bespoke systems.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="capabilities-expect-instead">
      <h2>What clients can expect instead</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clear communication</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Explicit technical decisions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Modern, maintainable systems</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Human review at every stage</strong>></li>
          <li><strong>Software that behaves consistently — even as it grows</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Capabilities, grounded in judgment</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Auralicode doesn’t promise everything. It promises systems that hold together. If you’re building something that matters — and you want it done with intention — we should talk.</p>
