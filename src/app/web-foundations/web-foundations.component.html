      <h1>WHY THESE PRICES?</h1>
      <p>My pricing reflects two decades of full-stack engineering, architecture, cloud orchestration, and design experience. Instead of paying for an agency full of junior developers, you get one senior engineer responsible for every line of code, every system, and every decision — resulting in faster delivery, tighter quality control, and dramatically better long-term stability</p>

      <h1>Fast, Flexible, and Built to Grow</h1>
      <p>The most powerful platforms start with strong foundations. These first two tiers focus on clarity, speed, and beautiful design — ideal for personal brands, nonprofits, and small businesses ready to make a strong online impression.</p>
