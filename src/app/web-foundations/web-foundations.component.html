      <h1>WHY THESE PRICES?</h1>
      <p>My pricing reflects two decades of full-stack engineering, architecture, cloud orchestration, and design experience. Instead of paying for an agency full of junior developers, you get one senior engineer responsible for every line of code, every system, and every decision — resulting in faster delivery, tighter quality control, and dramatically better long-term stability</p>
