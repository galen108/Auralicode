      <h1>Founder / Executive Bio — Galen W. Tenney</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="founder-bio-body">
      <p>Galen Tenney is Founder and Lead Architect of Auralicode LLC, a bespoke web development practice rooted in listening, service, and purposeful craftsmanship. Based in the Mid-Atlantic region and living with his wife Pamela, Galen builds technology with a profoundly human approach: empathetic, ethical, intentional, and grounded in real care for those he serves.
      </p>
      <p>With more than 15 years of professional web development experience — and over 27 years of continuous working life — Galen has led and contributed to mission-critical digital solutions for federal agencies, public institutions, nonprofit organizations, and community initiatives. His prior background includes serving as Lead Programmer for the Maryland Office of the Public Defender; building federal systems for the U.S. Coast Guard, State Department, General Services Administration, and NOAA; and developing meaningful digital platforms for nonprofit and civic organizations like Montgomery County Public Libraries and Light of the World Foundation. These foundational experiences in public sector service now inform the high-level architecture and ethics he brings to his private-sector partnerships.
      </p>
      <p>Galen’s path isn’t the “polished corporate ladder” narrative — and he doesn’t want it to be. His career reflects resilience, humility, and lived empathy. He has served in healthcare, worked retail and frontline jobs, supported aging communities, rebuilt after layoffs and closures, and continually reinvented himself. This real-world experience deeply informs how he builds technology: with respect, dignity, patience, and a genuine commitment to helping people.
      </p>
      <p>A lifelong Apple enthusiast, designer at heart, developer by discipline, and musician and writer by love, Galen brings together creativity, precision, beauty, and function in everything he creates. He believes technology should support humanity, not overshadow it. It should empower, not dominate. It should listen before it speaks. That belief is embedded directly into the name Auralicode—Aural (listening, presence, human experience) + Code (craft, structural intelligence, execution).
      </p>
      <p>Spiritually grounded and guided by the principle “love God, love your neighbor,” Galen approaches his work as a vocation of service. He is proudly progressive, valuing fairness, dignity, accessibility, inclusivity, and justice — and he believes technology should reduce burdens, not deepen inequity.
      </p>
      <p>Today, through Auralicode, Galen partners with individuals, small businesses, nonprofits, ministries, public institutions, and mission-driven organizations to build modern web applications, elegant websites, UX experiences that feel right, and digital solutions that actually benefit the people who use them. Whether I am building an <a mat-list-item routerLink="/web-foundations" routerLinkActive="activebutton" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">Essential Web Foundation</a> or a complex <a mat-list-item routerLink="/enterprise-grade" routerLinkActive="activebutton" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">Enterprise-Grade system</a>, I apply the same lens of precision and beauty.
      </p>
      <p>For Galen, this isn’t just business. It’s purpose. It’s calling. It’s joy. This purpose is what drives my specific technical philosophy—you can read how these values translate into the architecture I build on my Coding Vision page.
