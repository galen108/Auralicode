      <h1>WHY THESE PRICES?</h1>
      <p>My pricing reflects two decades of full-stack engineering, architecture, cloud orchestration, and design experience. Instead of paying for an agency full of junior developers, you get one senior engineer responsible for every line of code, every system, and every decision — resulting in faster delivery, tighter quality control, and dramatically better long-term stability.</p>

      <h2>Designed behavior, not accidental complexity</h2>
      <h3>Web Applications introduce real system behavior: users, data, logic, and interaction.</h3>
      <h4>This tier is for projects where the website is no longer just a presence — it’s a product.</h4>
      <h3>What this tier delivers</h3>
      <h4>Applied capabilities:</h4>
      • Component-driven frontend architecture
      • Stateful UI and predictable user flows
      • API-driven backend logic
      • Secure authentication and session handling
      • Role-based access (as required)
      • Explicit integration boundaries
      <h4>Technology is selected deliberately to support:</h4>
      • Consistent behavior
      • Future change
      • Security and clarity
      <h2>What clients experience</h2>
      • Users can sign in, act, and return reliably
      • The system behaves consistently across environments
      • Features can be added without breaking existing functionality
      • The application feels trustworthy with real data
      <h2>Best for</h2>
      <h3>SaaS products</h3>
      <h3>Internal tools</h3>
      <h3>Member portals</h3>
      <h3>Workflow-driven platforms</h3>
      <h3>Applications with active users</h3>

      <h2>Rate: $120 / hour
        Typical investment range: $6,000 – $18,000</h2>
      <h3>What changes at this rate</h3>
      <h4>This tier activates architectural responsibility.
        In addition to foundational capabilities, this rate covers:</h4>
      • Stateful frontend logic
      • Backend application design
      • Secure authentication and session handling
      • Business logic and data modeling
      • Explicit integration boundaries
      <h4>At this level, Auralicode is responsible not just for how the system looks — but how it behaves.</h4>

    <h2>Every tier reflects the same philosophy.</h2>
    <h3>What changes is how much of the system is activated.</h3>
    <h4>If you’re building something that matters — and you want it to hold together as it grows — we should talk.</h4>
