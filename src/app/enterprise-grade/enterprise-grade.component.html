      <h1>WHY THESE PRICES?</h1>
      <p>My pricing reflects two decades of full-stack engineering, architecture, cloud orchestration, and design experience. Instead of paying for an agency full of junior developers, you get one senior engineer responsible for every line of code, every system, and every decision — resulting in faster delivery, tighter quality control, and dramatically better long-term stability.</p>

      <h2>Coherence at scale</h2>
      <h3>Enterprise engagements focus on architectural leadership across complex systems.</h3>
      <h4>This tier is not about size alone — it’s about responsibility:</h4>
      • Multiple platforms
      • Multiple integrations
      • Multiple stakeholders
      • Long time horizons
      <h3>What this tier delivers</h3>
      <h4>Full expression of Auralicode capabilities:</h4>
      • Unified identity and authentication models
      • Cross-platform session coherence
      • Complex role and permission systems
      • Multi-service and third-party integrations
      • Cloud architecture designed for observability and recovery
      • Explicit system boundaries and ownership
      • Long-term technical stewardship
      • Every decision is documented, justified, and revisited as the system evolves.
      <h2>What clients experience</h2>
      <h3>Systems that behave consistently across teams and platforms</h3>
      <h3>Reduced architectural risk</h3>
      <h3>Predictable change instead of compounding chaos</h3>
      <h3>A partner who thinks in systems, not tickets</h3>
      <h2>Best for</h2>
      <h3>Organizations with existing complexity</h3>

      <h2>Rate: $120 / hour (architectural leadership & stewardship)
        Typical engagement range: $40,000 – $120,000+</h2>
      <h3>Often multi-phase or ongoing</h3>
      <h4>What this rate truly represents
        At the Enterprise level, Auralicode assumes responsibility for:</h4>
      • System-wide coherence
      • Identity and authentication architecture
      • Cross-platform session integrity
      • Complex integrations and dependencies
      • Cloud architecture and observability
      • Long-term technical guidance
      <h3>This is not “more coding per hour.”</h3>
      <h4>It is more consequence per decision.</h4>
    </section>

    <h2>Every tier reflects the same philosophy.</h2>
    <h3>What changes is how much of the system is activated.</h3>
    <h4>If you’re building something that matters — and you want it to hold together as it grows — we should talk.</h4>
