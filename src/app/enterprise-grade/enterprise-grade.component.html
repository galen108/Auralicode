          <li>Every decision is documented, justified, and revisited as the system evolves.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What clients experience:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Systems that behave consistently across teams and platforms</li>
          <li>Reduced architectural risk</li>

          <li>A partner who thinks in systems, not tickets</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Best for:</h2>
          <h4>Organizations with existing complexity</h4>
          <h4>Platforms spanning web, mobile, and services</h4>
          <h4>Products with regulatory, security, or scale concerns</h4>
          <h4>Teams needing architectural clarity and continuity</h4>

      <section class="enterprise-grade-pricing">
        <h2>Why These Prices?</h2>
          <p>My pricing reflects two decades of full-stack engineering, architecture, cloud orchestration, and design experience. Instead of paying for an agency full of junior developers, you get one senior engineer responsible for every line of code, every system, and every decision — resulting in faster delivery, tighter quality control, and dramatically better long-term stability.</p>

      <section class="enterprise-grade-scope">
        <h2>Rate: $120 / hour (architectural leadership & stewardship) — Typical engagement range: $40,000 – $120,000+</h2>
        <h3>Often multi-phase or ongoing</h3>
        <h4>What this rate truly represents — At the Enterprise level, Auralicode assumes responsibility for:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>System-wide coherence</li>
          <li>Identity and authentication architecture</li>
          <li>Cross-platform session integrity</li>
          <li>Complex integrations and dependencies</li>
          <li>Cloud architecture and observability</li>
          <li>Long-term technical guidance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>This is not “more coding per hour.”</h3>
        <h4>It is more consequence per decision.</h4>

      <h2>Every tier reflects the same philosophy.</h2>
      <h4>What changes is how much of the system is activated.</h4>
        <p>If you’re building something that matters — and you want it to hold together as it grows — we should talk.</p>
